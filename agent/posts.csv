AI is evolving at a breakneck speed.

↳ It can now create almost lifelike videos.
↳ The difference in just one year is stunning.

A year ago, AI-generated videos were often glitchy and unrealistic.

For example, the AI video of Will Smith eating spaghetti was called ""nightmarish."" 

Faces were all wrong, and the video lacked fluidity.

Today, things are totally different.

AI has improved so quickly that the same video now looks almost real. 

The side-by-side comparison is shocking.

Here's how AI has evolved:

1) More realistic and detailed scenes.
2) Complex camera motions.
3) Multiple characters with vibrant emotions.
4) Enhanced fluidity and realism.
5) Better handling of facial expressions.
6) Improved background details.
7) Higher quality in visual effects.
8) Enhanced lighting and shadows.
9) Faster processing times.

AI is getting better at creating lifelike videos.

The more we talk about it,
the more we understand its rapid progress.

Today, things are totally different.

AI has improved so quickly that the same video now looks almost real. 

The side-by-side comparison is shocking.

Here's how AI has evolved:

1) More realistic and detailed scenes.
2) Complex camera motions.
3) Multiple characters with vibrant emotions.
4) Enhanced fluidity and realism.
5) Better handling of facial expressions.
6) Improved background details.
7) Higher quality in visual effects.
8) Enhanced lighting and shadows.
9) Faster processing times.

AI is getting better at creating lifelike videos.
